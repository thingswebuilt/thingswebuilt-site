# Conquering the Zombie Apocalypse: A Journey Through Innovation and Strategy
Welcome to our latest update on the journey to Pi Wars 2024, where our team is gearing up to face the thrilling Zombie Apocalypse challenge. With creativity, technical prowess, and a dash of sci-fi flair, we're excited to share the progress of our robot's specialized attachment designed to take down the undead with precision and style.

## The Challenge Ahead
The Zombie Apocalypse challenge tasks our robot with clearing zombies from the Pi Wars Tower. With a mix of remote control and autonomous operation, the challenge pushes the limits of our engineering and programming skills, requiring us to knock down targets without crossing a foul line. Precision, power, and strategic planning are key.

## Designing for Victory
Our approach has been to refine and innovate, building on our previous successes. The heart of our design is an attractive enclosure that houses a pan and tilt mechanism, driving a flywheel-driven ball flinger. This year, we've integrated high-resolution Waveshare digital serial servos for pinpoint accuracy, ensuring we hit those small targets every time.

## Stealth and Style
Inspired by feedback and pop culture, our "gun turret" cover resembles a stealthy, faceted head, echoing the dual significance of "Kryten" from Red Dwarf and the Mark 8 naval gun. This not only adds a cool, sci-fi aesthetic but also aligns with our goal for a sleek, unobtrusive design.

## The Heart of Control
Choosing the right microcontroller is crucial. Our specs demand something small yet capable, fitting within our design without compromising on functionality. It needs to handle everything from servo movements to sensor inputs, ensuring seamless operation during the heat of competition.

## The Road to Autonomous Precision
With the inclusion of a distance sensor and considerations for potential image classification, our robot aims not just for brute force but intelligent, precise targeting. The recent allowance of manual laser pointers for target indication adds another layer to our strategy, offering a blend of high-tech and practical solutions to ensure victory against the zombie horde.

## Reflections and Next Steps
As we finalize our design and move into testing, the excitement within the team is palpable. Our modular approach, focusing on unit testing and adaptability, has allowed us to iterate rapidly, adapting to feedback and new ideas. 

Stay tuned as we continue our journey, refining our designs, and preparing for the challenges ahead. The zombies won't stand a chance!
