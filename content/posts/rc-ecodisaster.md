# Navigating the Eco-Disaster: A Manual Prelude to Autonomy

In the heart of our preparations for the Eco-Disaster challenge at Pi Wars, we took to the arena in manual mode, a crucial step before unleashing our robot autonomously. This challenge, a test of precision and speed, requires our robot to distinguish and sort barrels of 'toxic slime'—a task demanding both agility and strategy.

In our manual test of the Eco-Disaster challenge, the "Virtual Ackermann" steering showcased exceptional maneuverability, laying any concerns to rest. A notable tactic emerged: driving past barrels to collect them en route to the end zone, hinting at the potential benefits of an active grabber for more direct approaches. Impressively, with a grabber designed to handle multiple barrels, completing the challenge swiftly became feasible. On just the second attempt, and with a robot that was initially challenging to control, we managed to collect all barrels in under two minutes—a promising sign for our autonomous endeavors.

Our approach blended meticulous planning with the adaptability afforded by a manual test run. We discovered the virtue of patience and precision over speed; even at 0.1m/s, controlling our robot required a delicate touch. Surprisingly, we found maneuvering in reverse simplified aligning with the barrels, an insight that could significantly influence our autonomous strategy.

The test also underscored the importance of robust design choices. From the effectiveness of simple filament guides for steering barrels to the potential of a wide scoop for handling multiple barrels, each observation feeds into refining our robot. We're contemplating a shift towards computer vision to preemptively identify barrel colors, enhancing our strategy for moving multiple barrels efficiently.

As we pivot towards autonomous control, these lessons form the cornerstone of our strategy. The challenge ahead is daunting, but with each test, our path to a podium finish at Pi Wars becomes clearer. Stay tuned for our next update, where we'll share our progress on integrating autonomous capabilities, aiming for a seamless blend of speed, precision, and strategic foresight.
