The Robotics Revolution: Pimoroni's Yukon vs. Our Custom PCB
In the evolving world of robotics, the choice between modular platforms and custom-built solutions is a pivotal decision for teams. Pimoroni's recent release of the Yukon, a RP2040 based board, has sparked interest among robotics enthusiasts, including our team. Here's a closer look at how Yukon stacks up against our custom PCB designed for the Pi Wars robot.

Introducing Yukon
The Yukon board, with its 67 x 84 x 18mm dimensions, offers a compact yet versatile foundation for robotics projects. The platform's ability to accept add-on modules for customization—like the "Big Motor + Encoder Module" and the "Quad Servo Module"—provides flexibility for various tasks, from motor control to servo management.

Cost and Design Considerations:
The Yukon setup, with necessary add-ons costing £87, contrasts with our custom PCB's initial £100 (for two boards) that might double if redesigns are needed. While Yukon presents a cost-effective solution, our custom PCB, tailored precisely to our specifications, justifies its higher cost through exacting customization.

Functionality and Fit:
Mapping Yukon's slots to our PCB functions shows a close match, covering drive motors with encoders and servo power plus communication needs. However, features like an ideal diode for auxiliary power and a drive power switch require external solutions when opting for Yukon. Our custom PCB integrates these functionalities directly, streamlining the design.

Conclusion:
The Yukon offers an excellent, flexible platform for many robotics teams, providing a robust foundation with its modular approach. However, for our specific needs and aspirations in Pi Wars, the precision and customization afforded by our bespoke PCB remain paramount. This decision reflects our commitment to achieving the best possible performance, even at a higher cost and complexity.
